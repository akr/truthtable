= truthtable - truth table to logical formula

The truthtable library generates a truth table from
a logical formula written in Ruby.
The truth table can be converted to a logical formula.

== Feature

* generate a truth table from a given block written in Ruby.
* generate a formula from the table:
  * minimal one (obtained by Quine-McCluskey algorithm)
  * disjunctive normal form
  * conjunctive normal form

== Usage

* require

  require 'truthtable'

* puts, p and pp shows truth table

   puts TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] & v[1] }
   #=>
   v[0] v[1] | 
   ----------+--
    f    f   | f
    f    t   | f
    t    f   | f
    t    t   | t

   p TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] & v[1] }
   #=> #<TruthTable: !v[0]&!v[1]=>false !v[0]&v[1]=>false v[0]&!v[1]=>false v[0]&v[1]=>true>

   require 'pp'
   pp TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] & v[1] }
   #=>
   #<TruthTable:
    !v[0]&!v[1]=>false
    !v[0]& v[1]=>false
     v[0]&!v[1]=>false
     v[0]& v[1]=>true>

* '?' is shown for non-evaluated variable

   puts TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] && v[1] }'
   #=>
   v[0] v[1] | 
   ----------+--
    f    ?   | f
    t    f   | f
    t    t   | t

   puts TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] || v[1] }'
   #=>
   v[0] v[1] | 
   ----------+--
    f    f   | f
    f    t   | t
    t    ?   | t

   puts TruthTable.new {|v| !v[0] ? !v[1] : !v[2] }'
   #=>
   v[0] v[1] v[2] | 
   ---------------+--
    f    f    ?   | t
    f    t    ?   | f
    t    ?    f   | t
    t    ?    t   | f

* formula generation

   p TruthTable.new {|v| !v[0] }.formula        #=> "!v[0]"
   p TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] & v[1] }.formula  #=> "v[0]&v[1]"
   p TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] | v[1] }.formula  #=> "v[0] | v[1]"
   p TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] ^ v[1] }.formula  #=> "!v[0]&v[1] | v[0]&!v[1]"
   p TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] == v[1] }.formula #=> "!v[0]&!v[1] | v[0]&v[1]"

* shortcuts, && and ||, are not preserved

   p TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] && v[1] }.formula #=> "v[0]&v[1]"
   p TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] || v[1] }.formula #=> "v[0] | v[1]"

* actually any expression (without side effect)

   p TruthTable.new {|v| v[0] ? !v[1] : v[1] }.formula #=> "!v[0]&v[1] | v[0]&!v[1]"

* any number of inputs

   p TruthTable.new {|v| [v[0], v[1], v[2], v[3]].grep(true).length <= 3 }.formula
   #=> "!v[0] | !v[1] | !v[2] | !v[3]"
